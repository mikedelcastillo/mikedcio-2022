## Introduction

For most of my career, I've mainly used Hapi and Vue. This monorepo captures my journey of revisiting Express and React. 

## Development

```sh
npm install -g yarn
npm run clean
yarn install
```

## Build

```sh
npm run build
```

Or

```sh
yarn workspace api-express build
yarn workspace web-react build
yarn workspace web-next build
```
